# Website Semantic Search

This project enables semantic search across the content of any website. It is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend** (`website-search-backend`): Built with FastAPI and Pinecone for indexing and querying HTML content semantically.
- **Frontend** (`website-search-frontend`): A responsive Next.js + TailwindCSS application for users to index a website and perform semantic search.

## Structure
